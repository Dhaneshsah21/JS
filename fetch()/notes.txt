1. Async / Await
What it is:
async and await are used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations in a cleaner and more readable way than .then() and .catch().

Why we use:
Because using too many .then() chains (Promise chaining) makes code hard to read → async/await makes it simple and readable.
 
2. node.js

What it is:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine that allows you to run JS code outside the browser (for backend use).

Why we use:
To create servers, connect to databases, and run backend logic using JavaScript.

3.What is fetch()?

fetch() is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests to a server or API and get data (usually JSON).
It returns a Promise.
